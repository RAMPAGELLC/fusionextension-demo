## Important JSON keys
* The "id" key in manifest.json must be unique. It is recommended to generate a random snowflake ID based on your current time. You can create one at [Snowflake ID Generator](https://www.onlineappzone.com/snowflake-id-generator/).

* The "idkey" key in manifest.json must be a unique UUID. You can generate one at [UUID Generator](https://www.uuidgenerator.net/). It's crucial for extensions to have a unique ID to distinguish them from others.

* The "iconsbase64" must be your icon encoded in base64 format.

All keys within the example manifest.json file are required!

## Notes
A unique "idkey" and "id" will be assigned to your extension by the Fusion Staff Team if you submit it for inclusion in the Fusion Marketplace.
